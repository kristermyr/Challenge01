# Horiseon 

## Description

Refactoring existing code to meet accessibility standards so its optimized for search engines. 
I improved the websites code organization and accessibility standards. I learned how to replace non-semantic tags with semantic tags. Troubleshoot code to find location of code error for non functioning link. Learned that you can have both ID and class attributes attached to one element.
